- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Iteration 1 - 2025-12-06

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items passed on first iteration:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification focuses on WHAT users need without mentioning specific technologies.
2. **Requirements**: All 10 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous.
3. **Success Criteria**: All 7 criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "within 2 seconds", "100% of Markdown formatting").
4. **User Scenarios**: 5 prioritized user stories with clear acceptance scenarios.
5. **Edge Cases**: 5 edge cases identified for error handling.
6. **Assumptions**: 8 assumptions documented for clarity.

### Notes

- Specification is ready for implementation phase
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear
- Content reference section provides concrete content for implementation
- Plan.md already exists with technical decisions made
